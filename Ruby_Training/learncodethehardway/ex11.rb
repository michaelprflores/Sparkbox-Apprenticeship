# Exercise 11:Asking Questions

# Most of what software does is the following:
# 1. Take some kind of input from a person.
# 2. Change it.
# 3. Print out something tos how how it changed.

print "How old are you? "
age = gets.chomp()
print "How tall are you? "
height = gets.chomp()
print "How much do you weigh?"
weight = gets.chomp()

puts "So, you're #{age} years old, #{height} tall and #{weight} heavy."
