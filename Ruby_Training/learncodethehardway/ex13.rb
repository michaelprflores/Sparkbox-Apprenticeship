first, second, third = ARGV # first, second, third unpacks, assigning ARGV to three variables.

puts "The script is called: #{$0}"
puts "The first variable is: #{first}"
puts "Your second variable is: #{second}"
puts "Your third variable is: #{third}"

# scripts are .rb files
# ARGV is the argument variable
# ARGV is also constant

# I am not sure how all this works
