		<h2>What You&rsquo;ll be doing</h2>
		<p>In the first months of your apprenticeship, you&rsquo;ll be exposed to the core technologies of our work and work flow. Everyone, regardless of job title, will be brought to an understanding of Sparkbox&rsquo;s convictions on the priority of content, value of design, semantic HTML, and mobile-first CSS. You&rsquo;ll be exposed to our Github-centric project management, our deployment processes, best practices for clean code and separation of concerns, and unit testing techniques.</p>
		<p>By the end of your apprenticeship, you&rsquo;ll be interacting as a full-fledged team member. Your confidence will be up, you&rsquo;ll have some work under your belt, and that&rsquo;s when the real fun begins.</p>
		<p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/sparkbox/apprenticeships">apprenticeship GitHub repository</a> to get a really good sense of what you&rsquo;ll be doing.</p>
		<h2>Apply</h2>
		<p>How bad do you want it? What you provide us is very important â€” this is your opportunity to present your case. Choose your answers wisely, my friend!</p>
