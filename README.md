My Apprenticeship at [Sparkbox](www.seesparkbox.com)
==========================
They called me Flores in Dayton, Ohio. I am a visual designer making the leap into web development. This web development [apprenticeship](https://docs.google.com/a/heysparkbox.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG9LNXU2M05MZEVnUE4teHJqeW9VSUE6MQ#gid=0) gave me a much needed leg up. As of September 2014, I am pursuing a career in UX design and front-end development.

This is a repo of my work and projects. [View](PHASES_CHECKLIST.md) the path I'm taking.
